The core idea of LEAP is to efficiently model the aging-induced delay degradation at the coarse-grained FPGA basic blocklevel using deep neural networks (DNNs), while achieving almostthe same accuracy as the transistor-level simulation. For each typeof the FPGA basic block such as LUT and DSP, we first characterizeits accurate delay degradation via transistor-level SPICE simula-tion under a versatile set of aging factors from the FPGA fabricand in-field operation. Then we train one DNN model for eachblock type to learn the relation between its delay degradation andaging factors. Moreover, we integrate our DNN models into thewidely used Verilog-to-Routing (VTR 8) toolflow and generate theaging-aware FPGA architecture file. Finally, we develop the aging-aware static timing analysis to support analyzing the aging impacton the entire FPGA circuit. Experimental results demonstrate thatLEAP can predict the delay degradation of FPGA blocks more than104x to107x faster than transistor-level SPICE simulation, with themaximum prediction error of less than 0.7%.

There are two major classes of existing studies that model the aging effects in the circuit delay. One is at transistor-level, which is highly accurate but very slow. The other is at gate-level, which is faster but less accurate. Moreover, most prior studies only consider a limited subset or limited value ranges of aging factors.\nIn this paper, we propose Aadam, a fast, accurate, and versatile aging-aware delay model for generic cell libraries. In Aadam, we first use transistor-level SPICE simulations to accurately characterize the delay degradation of each library cell under a versatile set of aging factors, including both physical parameters (i.e., initial threshold voltage and transistor width/length ratio) and operating conditions (i.e., working temperature, signal probability, input signal slew range, output load capacitance range, and projected lifetime). For each library cell, we then train a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) to learn the relation between the input aging factors and output cell delay degradation. Therefore, for a given input circuit and a given combination of aging factors, we can use the trained FFNNs to quickly and accurately infer the delay degradation for each gate in the circuit. Finally, to effectively estimate the aging-aware lifetime delay of large-scale circuits, we also integrate Aadam into a state-of-the-art static timing analysis tool called OpenTimer. Experimental results demonstrate that Aadam achieves fast estimation of the aging-induced delay with high accuracy close to transistor-level simulation.","tags":[],"title":"Aadam: A Fast, Accurate, and Versatile Aging-Aware Cell Library Delay Model using Feed-Forward Neural Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seyed Milad Ebrahimipour","Behnam Ghavami","Mohsen Raji","Morteza Nabavi","Yvon Savaria"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1604133859,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604133859,"objectID":"02a8e9ab21bfb85bc1a3e62db32c0e91","permalink":"https://miladebrahimipour.github.io/publication/tvlsi-criticality/","publishdate":"2020-10-31T12:14:19+03:30","relpermalink":"/publication/tvlsi-criticality/","section":"publication","summary":"As CMOS devices become smaller, aging-induced and process variations become major issues for circuit reliability. In this paper, a statistical gate sizing method is proposed to improve the lifetime reliability of manufactured chips in presence of process variations and aging effects.

Using the proposed gate delay model, a Statistical Static Timing Analysis method is introduced to compute the circuit delay considering the joint effect of process variation and NBTI. To guarantee that the circuit meets the required timing constraints, we propose an incremental gate sizing technique. This technique first computes the criticality of each gate defined as the probability that a gate lies on the critical path due to NBTI and process variations.

It is worthy to note that, by using the proposed statistical gate delay model, we can compute criticality of each gate incrementally.

To analyse/optimise the timing of the circuit under process variation effects, statistical analysis/optimisation techniques are more suitable than the traditional static analysis/optimisation counterparts. Statistical gate sizing is an effective technique that is widely used to guide the timing yield improvement of digital circuits. Gate criticality, defined as the probability that a gate lies on a critical path, forms the basis for many of the existing statistical gate sizing techniques. Here, the authors introduce adjacency criticality to address the drawbacks of the conventional definition of gate criticality. It is defined as the probability of manufacturing a chip in which the gate lies on the critical path due to process variation considering the effect of the gates in its fan-out cone. Furthermore, the authors present the levelised Adjacency Criticality metric which provides a trade-off between the runtime of the criticality metric and accuracy of the Adjacency Criticality metric. In order to show the efficacy of the proposed metric, an adjacency criticality-based statistical gate sizing method is presented for improving timing yield of the circuit.","tags":[],"title":"Adjacency criticality: a simple yet effective metric for statistical timing yield optimisation of digital integrated circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seyed Milad Ebrahimipour","Behnam Ghavami","Mohsen Raji"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1551424609,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551424609,"objectID":"7a2803267f762d563d43e9184869eced","permalink":"https://miladebrahimipour.github.io/publication/csicc-icache/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T10:46:49+03:30","relpermalink":"/publication/csicc-icache/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we propose an Instruction Set Encoding technique to improve the lifetime reliability of instruction cache.

One of these challenges is transistor aging, which results in circuit performance degradation over time and eventually leads to lifetime reduction of the circuit. So far, various methods have been proposed using the Logic Resynthesis technique to reduce the effects of aging in a circuit. But the main problem with these methods is that they have a high runtime and are not applicable to large-scale circuits. In this paper, a partitioning-based logic resynthesis method is proposed to reduce the performance degradation caused by aging phenomenon in a digital circuit, which effectively reduces the execution time of the optimization process. In the proposed method, the circuit is divided into a set of smaller sub-circuits using cone structures. Then these sub-circuits are leveled and a subset of the most effective sub-circuits is selected for optimization. Finally, a logical resynthesis technique is applied to each sub-circuit which reduces the execution time of the algorithm. Also, by using the created sub-circuits, an attempt has been made to reduce the time overhead caused by recalculating the circuit delay after each round of the optimization process. The simulation results show that the proposed method with an overhead area of â€‹â€‹4.26% has reduced the efficiency reduction due to aging by about 14.8%.","tags":[],"title":"A Partitioning-based lifetime Reliability Improvement of Digital Circuits using Logic Re-synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seyed Milad Ebrahimipour","Behnam Ghavami","Mohsen Raji"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1519894550,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519894550,"objectID":"7fb141026a64b6e4179f8845f1146834","permalink":"https://miladebrahimipour.github.io/publication/csicc-logic-resynthesis/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T12:25:50+03:30","relpermalink":"/publication/csicc-logic-resynthesis/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A Fast Method for Aging Effects Mitigation in Digital Circuits using Logic Re-synthesis","type":"publication"}]
